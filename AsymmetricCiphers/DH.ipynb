    "- Definition  \n",
    "    A number $g$ is a primitive root modulo $n$ if the powers of $g$ generate all units modulo $n$ (the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^*$). Equivalently, the multiplicative order of $g$ modulo $n$ equals $\\phi(n)$ (Euler's totient).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Important special case (primes)  \n",
    "    For a prime $p$ the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $p-1$, so a primitive root modulo $p$ is an element of order $p-1$. Primitive roots always exist for prime moduli.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practical test for primes  \n",
    "    Let $p$ be prime and let the distinct prime factors of $p-1$ be $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k$. A candidate $g$ ($2 \\le g < p$) is a primitive root mod $p$ iff for every $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod p.$\n",
    "\n",
    "    If any test equals $1$, $g$ is not a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to find one (algorithm sketch)\n",
    "    1. Factor $p-1$ to get its prime factors $\\{q_i\\}$.  \n",
    "    2. For $g = 2, 3, 4, \\dots$ check $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\pmod p$ for all $q_i$.  \n",
    "    3. The first $g$ that passes all checks is a primitive root.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small example (p = 7)  \n",
    "    $p-1 = 6$, prime factors $\\{2, 3\\}$. Test $g = 3$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    $3^{6/2} = 3^3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 7$\n",
    "    $3^{6/3} = 3^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$  \n",
    "\n",
    "    So $3$ is a primitive root mod $7$. Powers: $3^1\\dots 3^6 \\equiv 3,2,6,4,5,1$ (all nonzero residues).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relevance to Diffie–Hellman  \n",
    "    In Diffie–Hellman you pick a prime $p$ and a generator $g$ (a primitive root modulo $p$ or at least an element of large order) so that repeated powers of $g$ produce the key space used for the exchange."

    "\n",
    "Why: the order of $a$ modulo $p$ is $p-1$. The order of $a^r$ is $\\frac{p-1}{\\gcd(r,p-1)}$. So $a^r$ has order $p-1$ (i.e. is a primitive root) exactly when $\\gcd(r,p-1)=1$.\n",
