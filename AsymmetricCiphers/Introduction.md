# Asymmetric Ciphers (Public Key Cryptography)

## Overview
Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a pair of mathematically related keys for encryption and decryption operations. Unlike symmetric ciphers that use a single shared secret key, asymmetric ciphers eliminate the need for secure key distribution by using separate public and private keys.

## Key Characteristics
- **Two-key system**: Each entity has a public key (publicly available) and a private key (kept secret)
- **Mathematical relationship**: Keys are mathematically related but computationally infeasible to derive one from the other
- **No key distribution problem**: Public keys can be shared openly without compromising security
- **Slower than symmetric**: Generally more computationally intensive than symmetric encryption

## Key Terminology
- **Public Key (Ka+, Kb+)**: Freely distributed key used for encryption or signature verification
- **Private Key (Ka-, Kb-)**: Secret key kept by the owner, used for decryption or digital signing
- **Key Pair**: The combination of public and private keys belonging to one entity
- **Digital Signature**: Authentication mechanism using private key to sign and public key to verify
- **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**: Framework for managing public keys and digital certificates

## Mathematical Foundation
Asymmetric ciphers rely on mathematical problems that are:
1. **Easy to compute in one direction** (forward direction)
2. **Computationally difficult to reverse** without special information (the private key)

### Common Mathematical Foundations:
- **Prime factorization**: Difficulty of factoring large composite numbers (RSA)
- **Discrete logarithm**: Difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in finite fields (DSA, ElGamal)
- **Elliptic curves**: Discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves (ECC)

## Key Distribution vs. Key Management
- **Symmetric ciphers**: Require secure key distribution center (KDC) or pre-shared keys
- **Asymmetric ciphers**: Solve the key distribution problem but require:
  - Public key authentication (certificates)
  - Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure
  - Key validation and trust management

## Common Use Cases
1. **Key Exchange**: Securely establishing symmetric keys over insecure channels
2. **Digital Signatures**: Providing authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation
3. **Hybrid Systems**: Combining with symmetric ciphers for optimal performance
4. **Secure Communication**: Initial handshake in protocols like TLS/SSL

## Advantages
- ✅ Solves key distribution problem
- ✅ Enables digital signatures
- ✅ Supports non-repudiation
- ✅ Scalable for large networks
- ✅ No need for pre-shared secrets

## Disadvantages
- ❌ Computationally expensive (100-1000x slower than symmetric)
- ❌ Requires larger key sizes for equivalent security
- ❌ Vulnerable to quantum computing (current algorithms)
- ❌ Complex key management infrastructure needed
- ❌ Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks without proper authentication

## Security Model
```
Alice wants to send message M to Bob:

Encryption: C = E(Bob_public, M)
Decryption: M = D(Bob_private, C)

Digital Signature:
Signing: S = Sign(Alice_private, M)
Verification: Verify(Alice_public, M, S) = True/False
```

## Performance Considerations
Due to computational overhead, asymmetric cryptography is typically used in **hybrid cryptosystems**:
1. Use asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a symmetric key
2. Use the symmetric key for actual data encryption/decryption
3. Use asymmetric signatures for authentication and integrity

This approach combines the security benefits of asymmetric cryptography with the performance advantages of symmetric cryptography.
