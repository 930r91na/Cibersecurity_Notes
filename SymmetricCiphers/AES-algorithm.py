# AES - symmetric block cipher 
# Block size: 128 bits (16 bytes) - the size of the plain text
# Kab + P  (AES) = C

# Input:
#   P - plain text (128 bits)
#  | 1N0 | 1N4 | 1N8 | 1N12|
#  | 1N1 | 1N5 | 1N9 | 1N13|
#  | 1N2 | 1N6 | 1N10| 1N14|
#  | 1N3 | 1N7 | 1N11| 1N15|
# In each column there are 4 bytes (32 bits)
# Process data as a block of 4 columns and 4 rows (4x4 matrix), 

# Kab - primary key (128 - 10 rounds, 192 - 12 rounds, 256 - 14 rounds)
# Iterative rather than feistel cipher
# 128 bits example
# k0 | k4 | k8 | k12|
# k1 | k5 | k9 | k13|
# k2 | k6 | k10| k14|
# k3 | k7 | k11| k15|

# Key is expanded to an array of words
# (44/54/60) words are generated
# Key sscheduling 


# 4 words will be used in each round 
# Each round undergoes to (9/11/13) rounds of processing
# 1. SubBytes - non-linear byte substitution using a substitution table (S-box)
# 2. ShiftRows - transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclic
# 3. MixColumns - mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column
# 4. AddRoundKey - each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round key using bitwise XOR

# The final round does not include the MixColumns step4


# AES-128
# 1 ARK with k0
# 9 rounds of (SB, SR, MC, ARK with k1 to k9)
# Final round of (SB, SR, ARK with k10)

# 1 SubBytes Step (SB Transformation)
# Each byte in the state is replaced with its corresponding byte from the S-box
# The S-box is designed to be resistant to known cryptanalytic attacks, it is created with a irreducible polynomial m(x)= x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 = {0x11B0}
# It is constructed by combining the multiplicative inverse in GF(2^8) with an affine transformation
# This non linearity layer is crucial to fight cryptanalytic attacks
